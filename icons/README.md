# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These icons should represent the Web to Notion extension, ideally featuring:
- A combination of web/browser and note-taking symbols
- Clean, modern design that works well at small sizes
- Consistent style across all sizes

You can create these icons using any image editor or find suitable icons from:
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)

The icons should be saved as PNG files with transparent backgrounds.
